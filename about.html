      <h1>About Pokemon</h1>
      <p class="content">
        Pokémon is a Japanese media franchise consisting of video games,
        animated series and films, a trading card game, and other related media.
        The franchise takes place in a shared universe in which humans co-exist
        with creatures known as Pokémon, a large variety of species endowed with
        special powers.
        <br /><br />
        In addition to Game Freak's development, Creatures provides support
        through their Pokémon CG Studio, which creates 3D models for the Pokémon
        in the games, and also develops some spin-off titles. In 1998, Nintendo,
        Creatures, and Game Freak jointly established The Pokémon Company, which
        manages licensing, production,publishing, marketing and deals for the
        franchise both within Asia and worldwide through The Pokémon Company
        International
